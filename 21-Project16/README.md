## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/hot-prospects-wrap-up):

>1. Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not.
>2. Add an editing screen, so users can adjust the name and email address of someone they scanned previously. (Tip: Use the simple form of NavigationLink rather than navigationDestination(), to avoid your list selection code confusing the navigation link.)
>3. All users to customize the way contacted are sorted – by name or by most recent.
