## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/guess-the-flag-wrap-up):
>1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
>2. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
>3. Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.
