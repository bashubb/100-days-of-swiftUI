## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/navigation-wrap-up):
>1.  Change project 7 (iExpense) so that it uses NavigationLink for adding new expenses rather than a sheet. (Tip: The dismiss() code works great here, but you might want to add the navigationBarBackButtonHidden() modifier so they have to explicitly choose Cancel.)
>2.  Try changing project 7 so that it lets users edit their issue name in the navigation title rather than a separate textfield. Which option do you prefer?
>3.  Return to project 8 (Moonshot), and upgrade it to use NavigationLink(value:). This means adding Hashable conformance, and thinking carefully how to use navigationDestination().
