## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge):
>Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
>
>  Breaking it down:
>  The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
>  The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
>  You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
