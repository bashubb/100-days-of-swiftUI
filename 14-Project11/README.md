## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/cupcake-corner-wrap-up):
>1.  Right now it’s possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
>2.  Modify ContentView so that books rated as 1 star are highlighted somehow, such as having their name shown in red.
>3.  Add a new “date” attribute to the Book class, assigning Date.now to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
