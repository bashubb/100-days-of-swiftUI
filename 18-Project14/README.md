Includes solutions to the [challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up).

## Topics

MapKit, Biometric authentication, Secure data writing, Comparable custom types, Documents directory

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up):

>1.  Allow the user to switch map modes, between the standard mode and hybrid.
>2.  Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.
>3.  Create another view model, this time for EditView. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving dismiss and onSave in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.

Additional challenges, from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/writing-data-to-the-documents-directory):

>1.  Before we move on, here’s a small challenge for you: back in project 8 we looked at how to create a generic extension on Bundle that let us find, load, and decode any Codable data from our app bundle. Can you write something similar for the documents directory, perhaps making it an extension on FileManager?
>2.  Also I've added posibility of deleting Annotations on the map by using context Menu.
